This project is a neural network written from scratch in MATLAB that can classify hand-written digits from the MNIST dataset.
It has one hidden neuron layer and uses momentum and backpropagation.
See HW3_report.pdf for a further summary.

Run my code like any other MATLAB script. Note that Problem1.m will output the figures used in Problem 1 and that
Problem2.m will output the figures used in Problem 2. Both will output the respective challenge tables in the
MATLAB Command Window.
